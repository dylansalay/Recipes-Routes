# Recipes-Routes
The Code Challenge
1.) As a user I want to see a list of links to recipes when I go to the home page
    Create a new route for each recipe in your data store for now
2.) As a user, I want to be able to click on a link, and be taken to a page that shows me details about a recipe.
    Lookup the recipe details from the data store and display them to the user
3.) As a user, if I navigate to a Recipe page that doesnâ€™t exist, I should see a message indicating so, and a link to go back     to the homepage.
